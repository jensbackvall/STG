# STG
This is the code for the STG database

STG stands for Scenekunstens Teknik- og Grejbank (Danish, meaning The Tech and Rigging Bank for the Performing Arts).

<hr>

STG is a sharing economy platform, where users (i.e. professional performing artists, such as dancers, actors, performance-
artists and others) can borrow the tech, lamps etc owned by other small companies and/or independent artists, making production
somewhat cheaper.

<hr>

STG is a simple webapp, running on Google App Engine, coded with Python using Jinja2.

Footnote: In it's current (beta) version, STG can only run in a standard browser window, but I will make it completely responsive,
probably using Bootstrap, by autumn 2017.
